        <p>
            Hi, I am Alwin Bhogal â€” an aspiring IT professional with two years of hands-on experience in tech, 
            seeking an opportunity to contribute to a dynamic company in the industry. I have a passion for building 
            computers, troubleshooting hardware and software issues, and programming. I love creating things from 
            scratch and enjoy blending technology with creativity to bring ideas to life. My technical skill set includes
            a broad range of tools and languages such as JavaScript, ReactJS, Python, Java, C, C#, Spring, Selenium, Git, 
            Linux, ThreeJS, Microsoft Excel, Blender, CAD software, and Distribution Design Studio, among others. I am constantly 
            expanding my expertise to stay current with evolving technologies.
        </p>
        <h2>
            Interests
        </h2>
        <p>
            Outside of tech, I enjoy outdoor adventures like disc golf, scuba diving, hiking, and camping. I am also an avid traveler 
            with a dream of backpacking across the globe and experiencing the world one place at a time.
        </p>

        <h2>
            What I am doing
        </h2>
        <p>
            Currently, I am focused on advancing my IT credentials. I have completed the CompTIA A+ Core 1 certification and am actively 
            preparing for Core 2 to complete the full certification. I also plan to earn the CompTIA Security+ and Cisco Certified Network 
            Associate (CCNA) certifications to deepen my knowledge and broaden my career opportunities in the IT field.
        </p>
